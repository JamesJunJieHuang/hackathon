# Hammer Time!

_Winner of the PTRI 9 Junior Hackathon_

Smash your favorite websites to pieces using the provided hammer. Break elements on the page until they fall off completely. Take out your frustration on a digital website, not your coworkers or family! Destroying things can be therapuetic, and you can always reset everything back to normal when you're done.

This extension uses JavaScript to inject audio, images, animations, and lots of CSS into the webpage you are browsing.
